# Keg-Washer

Raspberry Pi Automated Keg Washer

### About

This project is designed to automate the washing of a single Sanke keg. 


### Hardware

This is designed to use off the shelf hardware that should be accessible for most. It is worth noting that the
solenoid valves used in prototyping are not rated for food safety by any official standards. However, they are
made of cast brass, with a rubber gasket made of NBR (Nitrile Rubber) so it can be used with any fluid that will
not damage or be damaged by the rubber gasket material.
